Amidst the plethora of information available on the internet, ensuring that content shared within health community platforms is accurate, relevant, and trustworthy poses a substantial challenge. The indiscriminate sharing of web links, articles, and resources, while well-intentioned, can lead to a proliferation of irrelevant or misleading information, potentially jeopardizing the well-being of users and marking the platform as untrustworthy.
